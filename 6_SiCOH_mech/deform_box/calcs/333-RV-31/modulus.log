Stress-strain curve for all pos directions has been plotted to stress_strain/stress_strain.pos_all.png

Stress-strain curve for pos6 direction has been plotted to stress_strain/stress_strain.pos6.png

Voigt notation:
Bulk modulus: 4.3902 Gpa
Shear modulus: 2.5704 Gpa
Young's modulus: 6.4521 Gpa
Poisson's ratio: 0.2551
Confidence interval of moduli: 11.4996 Gpa

Crystal is mechanically unstable: stiffness marix is not positive definite.
