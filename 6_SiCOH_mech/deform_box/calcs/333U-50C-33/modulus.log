Stress-strain curve for all pos directions has been plotted to stress_strain/stress_strain.pos_all.png

Stress-strain curve for pos6 direction has been plotted to stress_strain/stress_strain.pos6.png

Voigt notation:
Bulk modulus: 21.1451 Gpa
Shear modulus: 7.9925 Gpa
Young's modulus: 21.2944 Gpa
Poisson's ratio: 0.3322
Confidence interval of moduli: 9.6662 Gpa

Crystal is mechanically unstable: stiffness marix is not positive definite.
