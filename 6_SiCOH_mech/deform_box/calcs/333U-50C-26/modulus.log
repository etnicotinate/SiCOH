Stress-strain curve for all pos directions has been plotted to stress_strain/stress_strain.pos_all.png

Stress-strain curve for pos6 direction has been plotted to stress_strain/stress_strain.pos6.png

Voigt notation:
Bulk modulus: 10.4939 Gpa
Shear modulus: 3.9309 Gpa
Young's modulus: 10.4837 Gpa
Poisson's ratio: 0.3335
Confidence interval of moduli: 9.7455 Gpa

Crystal is mechanically unstable: stiffness marix is not positive definite.
