Stress-strain curve for all pos directions has been plotted to stress_strain/stress_strain.pos_all.png

Stress-strain curve for pos6 direction has been plotted to stress_strain/stress_strain.pos6.png

Voigt notation:
Bulk modulus: 2.2577 Gpa
Shear modulus: 5.9964 Gpa
Young's modulus: 9.5418 Gpa
Poisson's ratio: -0.2044
Confidence interval of moduli: 9.2712 Gpa

Crystal is mechanically unstable: stiffness marix is not positive definite.
