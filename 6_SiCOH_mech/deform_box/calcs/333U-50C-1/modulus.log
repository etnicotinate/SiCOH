Stress-strain curve for all pos directions has been plotted to stress_strain/stress_strain.pos_all.png

Stress-strain curve for pos6 direction has been plotted to stress_strain/stress_strain.pos6.png

Voigt notation:
Bulk modulus: 22.9683 Gpa
Shear modulus: 1.7837 Gpa
Young's modulus: 5.2162 Gpa
Poisson's ratio: 0.4621
Confidence interval of moduli: 11.3343 Gpa

Crystal is mechanically unstable: stiffness marix is not positive definite.
