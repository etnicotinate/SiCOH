Elastic tensor has been written to C.log.
Stress-strain curve for all pos directions has been plotted to stress_strain/stress_strain.pos_all.png

Stress-strain curve for pos6 direction has been plotted to stress_strain/stress_strain.pos6.png

Voigt notation:
Bulk modulus: 23.5735 Gpa
Shear modulus: 6.9749 Gpa
Young's modulus: 19.0462 Gpa
Poisson's ratio: 0.3653
Confidence interval of moduli: 12.8495 Gpa

Crystal is mechanically unstable: stiffness marix is not positive definite.
