Stress-strain curve for all pos directions has been plotted to stress_strain/stress_strain.pos_all.png

Stress-strain curve for pos6 direction has been plotted to stress_strain/stress_strain.pos6.png

Voigt notation:
Bulk modulus: 10.6930 Gpa
Shear modulus: 3.4415 Gpa
Young's modulus: 9.3241 Gpa
Poisson's ratio: 0.3547
Confidence interval of moduli: 14.6729 Gpa

Crystal is mechanically unstable: stiffness marix is not positive definite.
