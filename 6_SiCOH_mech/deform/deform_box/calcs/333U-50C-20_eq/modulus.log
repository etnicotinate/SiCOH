Elastic tensor has been written to C.log.
Stress-strain curve for all pos directions has been plotted to stress_strain/stress_strain.pos_all.png

Stress-strain curve for pos6 direction has been plotted to stress_strain/stress_strain.pos6.png

Voigt notation:
Bulk modulus: 19.5290 Gpa
Shear modulus: 8.5335 Gpa
Young's modulus: 22.3458 Gpa
Poisson's ratio: 0.3093
Confidence interval of moduli: 14.4349 Gpa

Crystal is mechanically unstable: stiffness marix is not positive definite.
